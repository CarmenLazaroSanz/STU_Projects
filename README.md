# Shades_Makeup_STU

This project was part of my Data Analytics class for my MS in Big Data Analytics at St Thomas University. I am taking a deep analysis at inclusivity in the make up industry, concelears to be specific, by looking at make up brands products shades and composition. Paying close attention to lightness. 

This Dataset contained information regarding the shade at its components of different make up brands and products. Once the parameters were set of how each component influences the shade, I was able to further analyze.
